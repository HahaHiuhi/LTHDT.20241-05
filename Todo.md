# TODO List - Ecosystem Simulation (11/12/2024)

## Tasks to be Completed

### 1. **Move(), Reproduce() and Spawn() Functions Update**:
   - **Objective**: Modify the `move()`, `reproduce()` and  `spawn()` so that organisms can only move and spawn to unoccupied grid cells.
   - **Current Issue**: Organisms are allowed to move and spawn over a grid cell that is already occupied by another organism.

### 2. **Main Menu**:
   - **Objective**: Implement a main menu for the simulation that includes options for starting the simulation, adjusting settings, and viewing statistics.
   - **Steps**:
     - Create a simple command-line menu that allows users to select different actions.
     - Implement the following options in the menu:
       - Start Simulation
       - Settings (Adjust simulation parameters like tick duration)
       - View Statistics (Display information like total organisms, energy levels, etc.)
       - Exit

### 3. **Settings Menu**:
   - **Objective**: Allow users to adjust settings such as tick duration and the number of organisms spawned in the simulation.
   - **Steps**:
     - Add an interface to modify the tick duration (e.g., 500ms or 1 second).
     - Add an option to change the number of organisms spawned when the simulation starts.
     - Implement validation to ensure valid values are entered by the user.

### 4. **Calculations**:
   - **Objective**: Implement calculations to display statistics such as the total number of organisms, their energy levels, and the status of different species in the ecosystem.
   - **Steps**:
     - Track the number of organisms (Herbivores, Carnivores, Plants).
     - Calculate total energy and average energy of organisms.
     - Display statistics at regular intervals or when requested by the user.
     - Show the current status of the ecosystem (e.g., Alive, Endangered, or Dead).
     - 
### 5. **Update diagrams**:
   - **Objective**: Update use cases and classes diagrams.

### 6. **Cleaner Code**:
   - **Objective**: Refactor the code for better readability and maintainability.


### 7. **Report**:
   - **Objective**: Create a comprehensive report consisting of Word document, PowerPoint slides and demo video
